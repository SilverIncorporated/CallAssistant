    <p>This site showcases a healthcare themed chatbot that has a few very nifty features...</p>

    <p>On the <a href="https://callassistant.silverinc.org/onchat">Chats Screen</a>
        you can see the main viewport. Get started with the welcome message at the top of the On Chat tab.</p>
    <p>For an example automation to use with this assistant, navigate to the 
        <a href="https://callassistant.silverinc.org/appointments">My Appointments</a> tab and download the sample automation.
        then take this automation package and upload it to your personal workspace or another folder in Orchestrator,
        then deploy it as an automation and it will appear in the On Chat tab.
